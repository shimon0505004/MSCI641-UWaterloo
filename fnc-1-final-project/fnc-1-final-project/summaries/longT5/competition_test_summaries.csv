2559,"The White House and Kushner discuss setting up 'a secret and secured communications channel between the Trump team and the Russians. Kisilyak reports to his senior officials in Moscow that J.Kushner, father-in- law and confidante to then-president-election Trump, made this proposal at a meeting in Trump Tower on December 1 or 2 after receiving intercepted Russian communications from U. S. officials. The White house did not disclose the meeting until March, but people familiar with it say the Federal Bureau of Intelligence now thinks the encounter is important because it would have been"
2560,"The Washington Post is tarnishing everyone with the fake news they spread. A source close to Jushner tells Fox News that during a December meeting between Trump and Russia, the Russian ambassador proposed using a back channel to avoid further contact with the Trump administration. This was never discussed. Instead, it was only a ""one-off call for Syria"" that was raised in conversation. In other words, the plan was never talked about."
2561,"The source tells Fox News that Jared Kushner had a meeting with Russia on December 12, in which he suggested that the Trump campaign use Russian diplomatic facilities to shield meetings with Russian officials from spying. Kisilyak told his superiors at Moscow that the suggestion was a way for the Trump administration to keep an eye out for any signs of collusion between them."
2562,"President Trump'll be announcing his decision to leave the European Union in mid-March. He wants to use ""back channel"" communication with Russia to help the Trump campaign prepare for an attack on the U.S, which is based on the threat of a civil war. Jared and Kushner plan to use Russian diplomatic equipment to discuss the matter. The Washington Post reports that Kisilyak was taken a back by the suggestion that an American use Russian communications devices at its Embassie or Consulate - a proposal likely to carry security risks for Russia as well as those of the Trump team"
2563,"Trump unexpectedly fires James Comey, the head of the federal bureau, because the Justice Department has found that he improperly usurped the Attorney General's authority during the presidential election. The new director will replace him, and the White House says it is essential that a new leader be found for the bureau."
2564,"The day after the Senate Judicary Committee hearing about the scandal, Comey is fired. In a letter to the White House, Trump says that he does not have the authority to lead the F.B. because of the ""clear recommendations"" of both Rosenstein and Session. He blames Comey for hurting the bureau's reputation over the past year. Rosenstein also criticizes Comery for sending a false report on the newfound information about the former secretary of state. Trump hates him for his relationship with the former president. He accuses him of spying on people during"
2565,"On Tuesday, Trump dismisses James Comey as the director of the Federal Bureau because he receives a letter saying that he is not under investigation for mishandling the presidential campaign's e-mail scandal. A week later, on January 22, Comey greets Trump by kissing him and commenting ""Oh and there's James ... he's become more famed than me."" The White House brags about how angry it is that Comey has been getting more attention from the news about the Russian issue. In fact, some advisers are starting to worry about what will happen to"
2566,"In this chapter, the narrator explains how Donald Trump has fired James Comey, the former head of the Federal Bureau. He was in charge for several months of the investigation on behalf of the former secretary of state and one of his most trusted aides. Now that he's gone, Trump is going to have to find a new director for the bureau."
2567,"Trump has decided to fire the former director of the F.B. because of the Russia scandal. He says he was planning to do it when he realized that the Democrats had lost the election and should have won. Then he tells his staff that he asked James Comey three times about the Russian issue before he fired him. In each case, he told them he wasnt under investigation. This is likely to cause a new storm of criticism from the White House. On Thursday morning, Trump asks whether he is under investigation; this question would be highly irregular. A few days later,"
2568,"This paper discusses the safety of a number of GM foods, including corn, soy, and rape. It is important to note that there are many different types of gms out there, and it is difficult to know which one is safe for human use."
2569,"In this chapter, the narrator explains why it's so hard for people to find GM foods on the grocery store shelves. It's because they're made from seeds that have been ""rejiggged"" to increase yields and make them more cost-effective. But there's no way anyone can really know how much of an impact a new crop will have on human health."
2570,"In this chapter, Dr. Rivers explains that there is no way to know enough about the dangers of eating contaminated food without using scientific evidence. There are numerous scientific studies that prove that GMO foods are safe for human use, but there are still many scientists who oppose them because they do not know enough information about them to be confident that they are safe."
2571,"In this chapter, the narrator explains some of the most common criticisms that have been leveled against GMOs in the past few years. These include multiple toxins from geneticallymodified crops detected in maternal blood, multiple studies linking grain-based foods to food-borne illnesses, and no peer-reviewing papers on the link between GMO consumption and disease. The most recent paper claims that there is a strong relationship between glyphosterate, a herbicide used as an herbicide, and breastcancer. However, these studies do not prove that "
2572,"The narrator tells us that the intelligence community has been concluding that Russia is behind the hack of the DNC and Wikileaks, but there's still no solid evidence that it was the Russians who actually stole the Democratic Party's stuff. So now we have to believe that Russia really did steal the party's information and gave it to Wiki Leaks. It turns out that Seth Richard was killed in July by a DNC employee when he worked on voter-access projects for the Republican Party. This makes people speculate that both events were connected. A private investigator"
2573,"On May 16, 2017, Fox News reports that Seth Rich was murdered by eavesdropping on the Democratic National Committee's e-messages. The news also claims that there was an elaborate conspiracy between the police, the federal bureau of investigation, and the DC mayor's office to keep the case a secret. A forensic report showed that Richard had made contact with Gavin Macfadyenne, a former American journalist, document-dumping site Wikileaks. According to the federal investigator, 44,051 messages and 17,761, attachments between DNC leaders from January 15 through"
2574,"The family is suspicious of the connection between Seth Richard and Wikileaks, but they are confident that there is some sort of communication between the two. An FBI report shows that after he was killed, he made an initial contact with WikLeaks by way of Gavin Macfadyan, who was now dead. On July 22nd, just 12 days before Rich was killed in prison, Wikilesaks published inside DNC documents showing top party leaders conspiring to stop Senator Bernie Sanders from becoming the presidential nominee. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has resigned as D"
2575,"Seth Rich is a 27 year-old Democratic Party staffer who was shot in his home on Sunday, July 10 by a bullet fired from a street corner near his house. Some right-wingers believe that he was murdered because of too much information about the Clintons. They also believe that it was caused by Russian eavesdropping. The latest conspiracy theories are that Richard was not the one who hacked the DNC but was responsible for leaking the secrets to Wikileaks. Since the Trump administration has scandalized the American public, many conservatives have become interested in this story."
2576,"In January, students from the social sciences and humanities at the University of New York travel to a vulnerable region called the Me Kong River Delta in the South Pacific. They learn that sea levels are rising rapidly and will soon flood the area, affecting an estimated million people. The students also learn that the local people are willing to talk about climate change because it is not politically agendad. As they leave, they hear that the United States has signed the Paris agreement on climate change, which commits all countries to keeping temperature rise below two hundred degrees Celsius by 2100."
2577,"In this chapter, Dr. Barlow explains the basic science behind how climate change works. He first came up with the idea of using carbon dioxide as a counter-back to the theory that the world was going to get warmer. Then he predicted that the Arctic could get even hotter. Now, however, scientists have found out that the Earth has warmed up since the beginning of history. For example, in the Arctic, temperatures have gone up by 11C over the last three years. There are also new glaciers and islands disappearing from the Arctic Ocean. All these evidence points to the fact that humans are driving"
2578,"The Left is preparing to use the recent storm to fuel their conspiracy against man-made, or ""green"" climate change. Here are some of the most important facts about the hoax that have been revealed in the past few months. First, the Climategate Scandal proved that key information involving man made climate change was mismanipulated. In September of 2009, the United States began receiving leaked documents from scientists who were involved in the scandal. These included James Hansen and Philip Jones, two former NASA chemists. They also tried to lower past temperatures so that they would appear to be at an accelerated trend"
2579,"A new report by three climate scientists argues that the EPA's Clean Power Plan doesn't actually exist in the ""real world"" because it assumes that there is a ""tropical hot spot"" caused by rising concentrations of Carbon Dioxide. The scientists conclude that this is not true and argue that human health will be threatened by future climate changes. They look at the temperature records from various sources, including space-based surveys, balloons, and weather stations, and conclude that they don't have a trend for changing the temperature over time. Instead, they find that since 1977, El Ninos has"
2580,"In this chapter, the narrator explains that climate change is the ""big scam"" in the world. It's not just about money; it's also about people who don't believe in it. He compares the two industries: one to provide buyers with what they want and the other to a waste. The latter exists to give buyers what they need but to their mutual advantage. People buy things on the web because they want to spend their own money. The second is a fraud against the government. If all of this money were spent directly out of the pockets of poor people, then there would"
2581,"The next day, another bad piece of news comes out: Molina is losing money on the individual market. It turns out that Molina has been a big player in the marketplace since the beginning of the new system. If you don't pay for your health care, you won't be profitable. This means that instead of fixing the pool of people who bought insurance before, the market is going to get even worse. Republicans aren't doing much better than Democrats were when they first proposed it."
2582,"The House of Representatives on Wednesday rebukes the Affordable Care act for its failure. It is clear that the law has failed because it has improved every measure of health care spending, access, and cost since the adoption of the law. In particular, the bill has had a significant impact on lower-class Americans who have been unable to find medical care because their costs are too high. Overall national expenditures have fallen by nearly ten percent since the introduction of the federal government's health insurance program in the early 2000s. Private health plans have grown faster than expected since the Act came into effect. Medicare has seen an"
2583,"In this paper, Harker explains how the health law has changed the way Americans think about and use the law. It has allowed more than 20 million people to get health insurance through the law, making it possible for Republicans to make promises to all Americans that will make them healthier. The law has also made it easier for states to cut back on the price of health plans. However, many critics of the law still believe that the law did not make America healthier."
2584,"The Congressional Board of Accounts predicts that next year, millions of people will lose their health insurance if Congress doesn't repeal the individual-mandate provision. CBO calculates that only about two million people will be uncovered this year because of the tax penalty and other high-prices hikes. If Congress does not pass the individual mandate, however, there will be a significant increase in the number of people who will lose it. That includes 4 million people who aren't covered under current law but will instead choose to stay on the exchanges because they want to avoid paying steep taxes. This means that"
2585,"In this chapter, Adam Holmwood explains how the failures of the Affordable Care Act can be avoided. He outlines some of the most common reasons for why people lose their health insurance in the first place. For example, many people who get sick and need expensive medical care don't have enough money to buy a policy because they're too young and healthy to pay for it. Even so, there are still plenty of unlucky customers who fall prey to the rising cost of insurance."
2586,"In the House, conservatives have twice challenged the Supreme Court to overturn the law. The last federal government shut down was driven by Republican supporters who pushed for defunding the health care law. Now, however, it seems like the majority of Republicans support repealing the law and will continue to support it in the coming elections."
