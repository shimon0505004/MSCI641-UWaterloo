2541,"Last year, the average American consumed 247 eggs -- over 40 percent more than the world per-capita average.

2543,"Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease. The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting ofaturated fat has continued unabated ever since.Heart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon. Most likely, the studies that have linked the so-called ""Western diet"" to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates do.The ideal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is 1:1, but the typical American diet is more like 1:20. The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify."
2544,"Saturated fat is a type of fat that contains a high proportion of saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully “saturated” with hydrogen (H) atoms. Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil and dark chocolate.People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles. Eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large. This implies that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype. Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think.The low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death. Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be healthy and nutritious. People With Certain Medical Conditions may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet. Trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, and drastically raise risk of heart disease and diabetes.The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids. Blaming new health problems on old foods just doesn’t make sense. Humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years. The heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago."
2545,"Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk. Omega-3s from food helped; Omega-6s appeared to help. American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same.If cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem? Multiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, ""but it's not the only thing"""
2546,"In the past 30 years in the United States, the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent. In a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350,000 subjects, saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. The best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that’s low in carbs.The American Heart Association is still anti-saturated fat. Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high-fat diet to its citizens. The body loves saturated fat, but from sources like grass-fed meat and butter, whole eggs, and coconut fat — not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza."
2547,"Saturated fatty acids, found in animal foods, like dairy and meat, may lower risk of coronary heart disease. swapping these foods for unsaturated fats, whole grains, and plant-based proteins seems to boost heart health even further. The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats, saying they should make up no more than 10%."

2549,"High intensity training - or HIIT as it is known - is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training. But, if a person isn’t accustomed to this form of exercise, the workouts could be doing more harm than good, experts have warned. They revealed exhausting high intensity training can increase a person’s risk of heart disease and cancer."
2550,"High-intensity interval training sessions can last for just 20 minutes. Research suggests these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset Type 2 diabetes, as well as improving strength, endurance and muscle tone. Despite the evidence, controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon. There is a fear that HIIT can cause more harm than good."
2551,"High-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease. Researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods is more effective than continuous moderate activity.Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort. Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson's disease patients to move their arms and legs."
2552,"Axios reports that President Trump has told multiple people that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The report is based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday, Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week."
2553,"President Trump has privately told multiple people, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, that he plans to leave the Paris agreement on climate change. Publicly, Trump's position is that he has not made up his mind. Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could to do unravel Obama's climate policies."
2554,Donald Trump's intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday. One report cited “confidants” saying the president had made up his mind to pull out. A senior cabinet figure said he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue”
2555,"Axios reports that President Donald Trump has made the decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords. This report will certainly produce a major backlash from the anti-fossil fuel lobby in the U.S. and globally. The President was the only G7 leader who refrained from endorsing the Paris Accords on Saturday, a move that came after one of his advisers said Mr. Trump's views related to Paris were ""evolving"""
2556,"Trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind, but Axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision. The outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information, though Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute. Within the Environmental Protection Agency, staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and Pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be 'the President's victory'"
2557,"President-elect Donald J. Trump said he has ""an open mind"" on pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement. In an interview with the New York Times, he said he is ""looking at it very closely"" Environmental groups are skeptical that Trump's statements represent much of a change."
2558,"Jared Kushner was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. The back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration."
2559,"Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between the two countries. Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower. Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.Kushner told the Russians he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, the letter says. Officials who reviewed the letter said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events. In addition to setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a “Russian contact” in a third country."
2560,"A source close to Jared Kushner tells Fox News that the idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation. The Washington Post pushed the idea that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia."
2561,"The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation. In addition, the meeting focused on Russia's contention that the Obama administration's policy on Syria was deeply flawed."
2562,"Jared Kushner proposed a secret back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team during a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat. The intent was to connect Trump's then-chief national security advisor Michael T. Flynn with Russian military leaders, a source said. The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushner's attendance until March."
2563,"President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday. Trump said he acted based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The Justice Department found that Comey improperly moved to ""usurp"" the attorney general's authority and decided not to prosecute Clinton."
2564,"President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday. The White House cited ""clear recommendations"" from the DOJ and AG. Comey may have hurt the FBI's reputation or been embarrassed by him. He may also have been worried about the ongoing Russia investigation, which he confirmed in March."
2565,"The White House says that President Trump fired James Comey on Tuesday because he received a brief letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling for the FBI director’s dismissal. That letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign. A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming. The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week — and maybe much longer."
2566,"Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey yesterday (May 9) Comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the FBI. Comey was reportedly expanding the investigation into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. According to the White House, Comey had mishandled the Clinton investigation since the very beginning."
2567,"Donald Trump said he was thinking of 'this Russia thing' when he decided James Comey's fate. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia. Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president.Acting head of the FBI says Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff. Confronted with claim of Comey's unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: ‘That is not accurate’ McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia."
2568,As genetically modified (GM) foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems.
2569,"More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. Because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart."
2570,"Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely changed the way they look at the world. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time. There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why they should not be consumed.New study links GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease. Study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. Hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction.We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry's own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission's final review report.GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published."
2571,"Activists often cite the alleged potential health risks of genetically modified foods. Are these concerns credible? What do the studies cited actually claim? A recent article on Collective-Evolution.com outlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to “credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed”Glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong. The paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission. There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue.The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans. There’s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being “chronically ill” Any single issue that I’ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication."
2572,"Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, was shot and killed in July 2016. WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died. A private investigator said he had evidence to prove the theorists right. But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day.Gingrich said the DNC staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning"" There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia."
2573,"Fox News published an explosive report linking the death of murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich to tens of thousands of e-mails allegedly found on his laptop. The Fox report claimed that there was a conspiracy between the local police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the D.C. mayor’s office to cover up the investigation. Fox reported that the emails were internal Democratic National Party messages Rich transferred to Gavin McFayden, a now-deceased investigative journalist.Since the Fox story was published, he has been quoted in several news articles recanting his original story. We contacted the office of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to ask if there was a lurid connection between the mayor, the DNC, and Rich’s death, and got a flat denial from spokesman Kevin Harris. We also asked the police department about Wheeler's claims that the department was stepping back from the investigation. A spokesperson for the department denied it and said that the investigation remains active."
2574,"Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide investigator, said a federal investigator saw Rich's computer and the case file. A spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks ""unsubstantiated"" The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC.D.C. police have announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman has offered a separate $130,000 Reward for information on Rich's death. The reward is in addition to the $50,000 offered by the FBI."
2575,"Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer, was shot to death nearly a year ago. Since July, Rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories. The most recent theories claim that Rich, not the Russians, was responsible for leaking the emails.Seth Rich's death fit in with the “Clinton body count” theory, which dates to the 1990s. The theory claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don’t like. WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Rich as a distraction.Seth Rich, a 27-year-old data analyst for the Democratic National Committee, was shot in the back in May. In August, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize for information about Rich's murder. Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker.Fox News retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,” an editor’s note explained. Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media's focus on other stories.The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks. But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive."
2576,"A group of Cornell University undergraduates travelled to the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change. They met with farmers, climate experts, government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place. By 2100 much of the region will likely be underwater, affecting millions more."
2577,"Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990."
2578,"Climate change has not been a major theme this election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore. Despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way. Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change."
2579,"Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys. They found the so-called “tropical hotspot’ relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos. “Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” he said."
2580,"Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year. It’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry. But there's a key difference between these two industries. One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.Bats evolved with few predators - flying at night helps - until the modern world. But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away.It's not just the waste that's so bad it's worse than that. The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers. The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) The human suffering of those 345,000 German households who can’t pay their electricity bills."
2581,"Molina Healthcare lost $110 million on the Obamacare exchanges last year. David Frum: Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. He says Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool. Frump: Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate, the exchanges are not going to stabilize."
2582,"Every measure of healthcare spending, access and cost has improved since the Affordable Care Act. The GOP has had six years to come up with an alternative plan, and never has done so. The uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly 16% in 2010 to less than 10%.No one claimed the Affordable Care Act was perfect or that it would solve America’s healthcare crisis in one swipe. The fact that the GOP will have to face is that bringing healthcare to more Americans costs money. Taking it away from millions of Americans will cost money, too."
2583,"Julian Zelizer: The Affordable Care Act has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. He says for those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way, he says.Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product. Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable. It will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health."
2584,"Congressional Budget Office says millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. Julian Zelizer: CBO’s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, he says, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. Zelizer says the GOP bill retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019.CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law, writes Julian Zelizer. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO's speculations, he says. Zelizer: Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace."
2585,"Illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more. A first tranche of states approved 2017 rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases. Many consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market.Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. Imagine the pricing competition that would unleash. We can deny the current system's failings, or we can parlay our evolving knowledge into something much better."
2586,"Some suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. John Avlon: Maybe, but don’t count on it. He says Obamacare is working extremely well and is insulating itself from repeal.Avlon: But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of dysfunction employed by conservatives.When government messes up, when it shuts down, the winners are those who can say: “See? We told you. Government’s broken!” Never mind that those making that case are the ones doing the breaking. The more we elevate that case, the closer we get to the road back to Factville."
