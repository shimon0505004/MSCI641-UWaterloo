While tokenizing the corpus, we processed the lines to tokenize lines into lowercased words.
Also, while tokenizing, we processed the common apostophie words to expand to full form (should've to should).
While processing the '.' as end of line marker, we tried to account for the case where it could be used to denote 
decimal points.
