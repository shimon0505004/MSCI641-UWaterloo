They are both great but the Cellet has a nicer padded ear piece and a longer straight cable.
This one has a coiled cable and comes with the multi media / mic speaker splitter for PC use.
The coiled cable makes the length of the cable a bit shorter when it is relaxed or not stretched.Audio quality is great on both.
You can trigger this by pressing the button but I did not do that.
My guess is the connection to the phone may have been intermittent simulating a button press.
Very happy with my purchase and the pink is as dark as the picture, very pleased!!.
works good use as spare i love it would recomend it to everyone.
i keep it in a special place in case i go somewhere i'll have it on hand would recommend to use.
i really like this product since pink is my favorite color, but after around a week of having it, my phone stops charging randomly.
I'm not sure if somethings wrong with the charger or my phone but this hasnt happened to me before.
I love this along with my pink charging boxThis product does it's job no problemsLove it would recommend it.
The pinks are mine! I love the colors!!! They work very well! Can't wait to show everyone! Thank you so much.
I ordered this charger b/c it was hot pink.
